Hi 👋 Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm Daniel Lis, an economic policy professional, currently based in NYC working in digital assets and international finance policy. I've previously consulted with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Market Group and served as the Director of Public Policy at GoQuant Technologies Inc., where I lead the company's global policy engagement efforts.

Interested in discussing the following: 

Digital assets and cryptocurrency 
International economic and finance policy 
Technology and innovation 
Basketball, chess, and musical theatre 🏀🎭♟️

I'm also always open to new challenges and opportunities, so feel free to reach out if you have anything in mind.
